At the beginning of the season the egg rolled out of the nest and it was decided to incubate him artificially, but after his successful hatching he was returned to his parents who raised him. Zazu and GB 25 have successfully raised multiple chicks over the years including Honey in 2015 and GB 26 in 2019, both who have been successfully released.",
