  "description": "PW 01 was born on 4 June 2021 at VulPro. PW 01 was born in nest 17 in the breeding enclosure to his parents Jamima and GB 69, but was incubated and raised by his foster parents, Conan and Sherry in nest 21 after their own egg was broken. Jamima and GB 69 laid a second egg, PW 09, which they incubated and hatched on their own. In 2020, Jamima and GB 69 were unfortunately unsuccessful, but in 2019 they laid two successful eggs, Roger Poppins and GB 30, both of whom have been successfully released.",
