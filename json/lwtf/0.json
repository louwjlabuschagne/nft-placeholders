  "description": "Maqoma was one of the greatest Xhosa military commanders and played a major part in the Sixth and Eighth Xhosa Frontier Wars during the early and mid-1800s. In 1822, committed to regaining his ancestral home claimed by the Cape Colony, he founded a new kingdom on the banks of the Kat river, close to Fort Beaufort in the Eastern Cape. Maqoma was hounded continually by colonial raids and eventually expelled from his territory in 1829. In 1834, faced with increased military pressure from the colony, Maqoma and his half-brother had no alternative but to take up arms in an attempt to prevent further loss of their land in the 'War of Mlanjeni' (1850-53), Maqoma used his skills as a general to lead a guerilla campaign. His unconventional tactics in the forested valleys of the Waterkloof frustrated even the most skilled British officers. Maqoma was sent to Robben Island twice, where he ultimately died alone, aged 75.",
