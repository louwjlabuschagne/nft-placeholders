  "description": "Duma Nokwe was the first African advocate of the Transvaal Supreme Court (now a provinsial division of the Supreme Court) and one of the ANC's leading politicians in the 1950s and 1960s. He was the organisational center of every campaign, every stay-at-home, every mass demonstration of the Defiance Decade and another ten years beyond it, which helped bring the ANC its mass membership and placed it securely at the head of the liberation movement. After completing his law degree in 1955, Duma started to practice as an advocate. Pursuing his profession proved difficult, however, as racist Apartheid laws prevented him from sharing an office with white advocates. He still managed to be an unofficial member of the defiance team during the 1956 Treason Trial, defending his colleagues while his own practice collapsed. As the ANC's Director of International Affairs in Zambia, Nokwe was the public face of the organisation for over six years. He often attended meetings of the Organisation of African Unity and the United Nations, and his diplomatic skills won respect for the ANC overseas. He died in exile and is buried in Lusaka.",
