  "description": "Mila, on the right, was born on the farm after her pregnant mum was rescued, along with 22 other pigs, from a very dirty and neglected piggery in the town of Tulbagh, some three hours from our sanctuary.  The pigs were going to be put down but we were able to get to them in time.  Mila was born with slight damage to one of her legs but it doesn't stop her from roaming far and wide, albeit with a slight limp.  She is now five years old and is thriving on the farm.  The friendship between her and Maggie is stronger than the one she has with her own mom!",
