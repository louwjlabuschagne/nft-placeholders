  "description": "Jasmine sheep was brought here after being raised as a pet by a young man who adored her as she adored him.  That was in 2018 and to this day she still stands by the gate where she last saw her owner, driving off in his white bakkie.  She looks intently at every white bakkie as it comes through the gate, wondering if it is her human, come back to claim her.  Her loyalty is so touching and also a little sad.  However, she does spend a lot of time with the rest of the flock and does have her favourite sheep friends.  There is no doubt though that she would rather be with her Dad and we can only hope that our love will eventually bring her some peace of mind.  She is a beautiful sheep and will come when called.  Her favourite is a soft stroke on the cheek.",
