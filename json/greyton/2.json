  "description": "Basil the goat was rescued as a baby by a very caring couple in August 2017.  He was sheltering by the roadside during a storm, behind an electricity substation, still with umbilical cord attached..  They looked after him for three years but realised their garden with dogs and cats was not the place for him.  He needed goat friends and his loneliness was making him aggressive.  In 2020 we offered him a home and after a great deal of butting our backsides he realised he was in a very good place with sixteen of his own kind to knock around with and he has turned into a contented, happy boy.  He will still knock us for six though if we turn our backs on him or try and drive him away from destroying one of our young trees!",
