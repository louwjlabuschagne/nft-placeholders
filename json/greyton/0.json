  "description": "Maggie is the black pig on the photo with the white piglet who is called Mila.  Both are available for sponsorship.  Maggie was a brood sow for many years and is one of the matriarchs of the farm.  She is small and very affectionate.  Despite having carried many babies her maternal instincts are strong and, even though we are making sure she never has to endure another pregnancy, she is protective and caring of the younger pigs such as Mila.",
